About NYNT:
NewYearNewToken is a web application that helps people to complete their new year resolutions.
As we know that completing new year resolution is important, yet it's so hard.
The goal is to split one big new year resolution into smaller monthly resolutions so that people
can complete their new year resolutions little by little. Which will make completing new year resolution
much easier. 
We also encourage people to complete their resolution by giving them bonus tokens for each monthly resolution completed.
To use the app, users just need to provide their phone numbers, and stake some NYNT tokens.

Development process:
We build the front-end of the web application using React JavaScript.
We are using Firebase Firestore to store and manage our data as we think that Firebase
is very user friendly. Firebase has a very straight forward and easy to use API to be used with React JavaScript.
We achieve realtime updates on our data by using Firebase realtime document listener, onSnapshot().

In this hackathon, we have the opportunity to learn about a new technology, which is Solidity.
Solidity enables us to create and deploy our NYNT token and its smart contract. 
Then, we use Web3-react library to connect our application to our NYNT smart contracts and MetaMask crypto wallet.

Another new technology that we learn is Twilio API. We are using Twilio API to send our
users reminders to complete their monthly resolutions. We choose Twilio because its API is
easy to use and has been used by many developers.
